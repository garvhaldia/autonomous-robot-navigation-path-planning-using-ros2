# autonomous-td3-navigation-
This project implements a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach for autonomous robot navigation in complex environments using ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) and Gazebo simulation. The implementation leverages the TD3 algorithm to enable robots to navigate to target positions while avoiding obstacles using LiDAR sensor data.
